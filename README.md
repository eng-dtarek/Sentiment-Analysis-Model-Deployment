## Project Description

The goal of this project is to use Amazon's SageMaker service to create a recurrent neural network that can determine the sentiment of a movie review.
I used IMDB data set for the purpose of training and testing the network. 
Finally, I deployed it to be used through a web app that interacts with the model.
